      <p>   
        After nearly ten years as an attorney, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for personal reflection.  I decided that I needed to make a change. I began exploring a variety of career opportunities.  Coding quickly lept out as an early contender: I had basic experience in my past, and I have always had an enduring interest in technology.</p>
      <p>In August 2022, I enrolled with <a href="https://www.Epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>. This page demonstrates my html and css proficiency, and exhibits a portfolio of my work.</p>
