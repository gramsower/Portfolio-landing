    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <img src="img/gregandbear.jpeg" alt="Headshot of Greg and his dog, Bear", width="200px">
      <p>After nearly ten years as an attorney, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for personal reflection.  I decided that I needed to make a change.</p>
    <p>I began exploring a variety of career opportunities.  Coding quickly lept out as an early contender: I had basic experience in my past, and I have always had an enduring interest in technology.</p>
    <p>In August 2022, I enrolled with Epicodus. This page demonstrates my html and css proficiency, and exhibits a portfolio of my work.</p>
