    <p>After nearly ten years as an attorney, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for personal reflection.  I decided that I needed to make a change.</p>
    <p>I began exploring a variety of career opportunities.  Coding quickly lept out as an early contender: I had basic experience in my past, and I have always had an enduring interest in technology.</p>
    <p>In August 2022, I enrolled at Epicodus. This page demonstrates my html and css proficiency, and exhibits a portfolio of my work.</p>
