  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>After nearly ten years as an attorney, in late 2021, I decided that I needed to make a change.</p>
  <p>So, I began exploring a variety of career opportunities.  Coding quickly lept out as an early contender: I had basic experience in my past, and I have always had an enduring interest in technology.</p>
